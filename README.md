# Black Hat C++ for learning
 I made this repo to update my practices learning the course "Black Hat C++: C++ For Pentesters" in EC-Council

#Notes
Best Practices

It is necessary to validate all input. Input validation is critical to prevent unexpected data from being processed. Developers should validate all input, including user input, data from external sources, and network input. Input validation should include checking for valid data types, length and range.

Use memory-safe constructs when coding. Memory-safe constructs, like smart pointers or reference counting, prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or null pointer dereferences.

Ensure that you are using library functions correctly. Developers should use library functions securly to avoid common vulnerabilities. Ex: strcpy < strncpy.
